# Challenge-week3

This webpage is designed to allow you to generate a random password.
The password must be between 8 and 128 characters long, selected by the user. 
You will be prompted for each of the desired character types, uppercase letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. 
All of the prompts that you select "ok" to will be included in the password and any that you select "cancel" for will not be displayed. 
If you select cancel for all 4 of the prompts no password will be generated.
After selecting all of your variables the randomly generated password will be displayed on the screen for you.
